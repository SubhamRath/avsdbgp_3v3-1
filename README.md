# A glance at avsdbgp_3v3 IP

**avsdbgp_3v3** is a Bandgap Reference circuit, which is used to generate a constant voltage reference in analog domain which is independent of temperatarure and supply voltage variations.

The objective was to achieve some specifications using only **open-source tools** with the Flow/FreePDKs provided by **VLSI Computer Architecture Research Group** [(**VLSIARCH**)](https://vlsiarch.ecen.okstate.edu/) at **Oklahoma State University** [(**OSU**)](https://go.okstate.edu/).  

To get an basic idea about this **IP**, the working principle, basic implementation, applications and significance, kindly go thru [**this**](/Prelayout/Files/BGR.pdf)

 ##  Future work and limitations
 
 - The reference voltage needs to be more accurate with specifications. 
 - A working Enable circuitry needs to implemented for easy switching of IP. 
 - The post layout spice file has parasitic BJTs. Their origin shall be studied and tried to get rid off. 
 - The Bipolar models are imported from LTspice.
 - The futurework involves working/obtaining on a compatible **Bipolar** model with osu180nm tech, Which is not included in OSU libraries.

### 1. Ngspice

[Ngspice](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/devel.html) is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits. Ngspice is an open project, there is no closed group of developers.

#### Installing Ngspice in Ubuntu 20.04

 Open the terminal and type the following to install Ngspice
```
$  sudo apt-get install ngspice
```

 ### 2. Magic
 
 [Magic](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/) is a VLSI layout tool.
 
#### Installing Magic in Ubuntu 20.04

Open the terminal and type the following to install Magic
```
$  wget http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/archive/magic-8.3.32.tgz
$  tar xvfz magic-8.3.32.tgz
$  cd magic-8.3.32
$  ./configure
$  sudo make
$  sudo make install
```
### Steps to clone this git repository in Unix based systems for simulating waveforms.

Open the terminal and type the following

```
$  sudo apt install -y git
$  git clone https://github.com/ankursah5/avsdbgp_3v3

```
##  Pre-Layout simulations

- To run and view the waveforms, type the following commands after cloning in above step.

 ```
$  cd avsdbgp_3v3/Prelayout/Cir/
$  ngspice
```
- This opens ngspice shell.
- **To plot Vref vs Temperature (-40 to 140C) at Rload = 100Mohms**, Type the following in Ngspice shell and press enter.

```
ngspice 1 -> source 1bgr_tv.cir
```
